This is just vibe coded file manager app that i made for my Linux DE <br>
It has option to view compressed files without opening other file compression apps, <br>
And extract in same folder or specified folder. <br>
It has special breadcrumps you can click on to move trough folders, or double click to enter address, <br>
It has option to color tag files or folders, open as root anything <br> 
Gnome Nautilus lacks so much, that this already seems better, even if it's not fully working

**Missing / to be fixed:**
<pre>
- Opening large archives
- Selecting multiple files visually while holding CTRL
- Missing add to places
- More file properties (icon change, more info)

- Maybe switch to Rust for more performanse or create custom node module
- Add split view
- Add better details view
- Add to places button missing
- Add some progress and loading information bars?
- Improve tabs loading context
- Add undo/redo for text editor and fix close button
- Generate thumbnails for images and videos, pdfs, change icon of empty folder
- Add share via button in context for files
- Drag and drop 
- Icon sizing style to be fixed
- Create buttons for places without text
- Multi select delete/copy
- Opening linked directories and folders
- Thumbnail caching!
</pre>
